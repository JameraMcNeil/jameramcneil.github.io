Overview

For my first project, I created a Jeopardy style game that's all about Black culture.

Once users come to the site, they can can select any box under the 5 topic categories that's under a dollar amount ranging from $100 - $500. When a user selects a box, the box turns pink and the question is revealed along with a selection of multiple answers. When you hover over the box, the question and answers zoom up, allowing users to clearly see their options. When a user clicks on their answer, they will recieve an alert that informs them if the answer is right or wrong. If the answer is correct, the user is informed they have recieved the dollar amount associated with that question box. Users can also learn more about the game by clicking the modal button before the game title.
